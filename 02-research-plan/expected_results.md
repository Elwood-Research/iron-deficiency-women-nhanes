# Expected Results: Iron Deficiency Without Anemia Study

## Overview

This document presents expected outcomes based on literature synthesis for the NHANES study examining iron deficiency without anemia (IDWA) and iron supplement usage effects in women aged 18-45. Expected values inform sample size considerations, power calculations, and interpretation frameworks for statistical findings.

## 1. Expected IDWA Prevalence

### 1.1 Overall Prevalence Estimates

Based on literature review of US population studies:

| Definition | Expected Prevalence | 95% CI Range | Source Basis |
|------------|---------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Ferritin <15 ng/mL (strict) | 10-15% | 8-18% | CDC/WHO standards [1,2] |
| Ferritin <25 ng/mL (broad) | 20-30% | 18-35% | Recent US studies [3,4] |
| IDWA (<15 + Hgb ≥12) | 8-12% | 6-15% | Calculated from components |
| IDWA (<25 + Hgb ≥12) | 15-25% | 12-28% | Alternative definition |

**Rationale:**
- WHO/CDC guidelines cite approximately 10% of premenopausal women have iron deficiency (ferritin <15 ng/mL)
- Recent studies suggest the <15 ng/mL threshold may underestimate true deficiency
- Broader definition (<25 ng/mL) captures women with iron depletion who may benefit from intervention

### 1.2 Expected Prevalence by Demographics

#### By Race/Ethnicity

| Group | Expected IDWA Prevalence | Relative Risk |
|-------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Non-Hispanic White | 8-10% | Reference (1.0) |
| Non-Hispanic Black | 15-20% | 1.5-2.0 |
| Mexican American | 12-16% | 1.3-1.6 |
| Other Hispanic | 10-14% | 1.1-1.4 |
| Other/Multi-racial | 10-13% | 1.1-1.3 |

*Rationale: Health disparities literature consistently shows higher iron deficiency burden in Black women, potentially due to higher rates of heavy menstrual bleeding and dietary factors [5,6].*

#### By Age Group

| Age Group | Expected IDWA Prevalence | Notes |
|-----------|--------------------------|-------|
| 18-25 years | 10-14% | Peak menstrual blood loss years |
| 26-35 years | 12-16% | Highest reproductive activity |
| 36-45 years | 8-12% | Declining with perimenopause |

*Rationale: Iron deficiency follows menstrual bleeding patterns, with peak prevalence during peak reproductive years.*

#### By Socioeconomic Status

| Poverty Ratio | Expected IDWA Prevalence | Relative Risk |
|---------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| <1.0 (below poverty) | 18-25% | 2.0-2.5 |
| 1.0-1.99 (near poverty) | 14-18% | 1.5-2.0 |
| 2.0-3.99 (middle income) | 10-14% | 1.0-1.5 |
| ≥4.0 (higher income) | 6-10% | Reference (1.0) |

*Rationale: Food insecurity and limited access to iron-rich foods contribute to higher deficiency rates in lower-income populations [7].*

## 2. Expected Effect Sizes: Supplementation on Ferritin

### 2.1 Primary Effect Estimate

**Hypothesis H1: Supplement users vs. non-users in IDWA population**

| Outcome | Expected Effect | 95% CI | Clinical Significance |
|---------|-----------------|--------|----------------------|
| Ferritin (geometric mean ratio) | 1.3-1.6 | 1.1-1.9 | Moderate increase |
| Absolute ferritin difference (ng/mL) | +5 to +12 ng/mL | +2 to +20 | Variable by baseline |
| % achieving ferritin ≥15 ng/mL | 25-40% absolute increase | 15-50% | Clinical normalization |

**Interpretation:**
- A geometric mean ratio of 1.5 indicates supplement users have 50% higher ferritin levels
- For a woman with baseline ferritin of 10 ng/mL, supplementation expected to raise to 13-16 ng/mL
- This represents a clinically meaningful improvement in iron stores

### 2.2 Dose-Response Relationship (H2)

| Dose Category | Expected Ferritin (vs. None) | 95% CI | Mechanism |
|---------------|------------------------------|--------|-----------|
| None (0 mg) | Reference (1.0) | - | Baseline |
| Low (>0-18 mg) | 1.1-1.3 | 1.0-1.5 | Multivitamin effect |
| Moderate (18-65 mg) | 1.4-1.8 | 1.2-2.2 | Optimal therapeutic |
| High (>65 mg) | 1.5-2.0 | 1.2-2.5 | High therapeutic |

**Expected Pattern:**
- Stepwise increase across categories
- Largest increment from None → Low (initiation effect)
- Moderate and High categories may plateau (diminishing returns)
- Optimal benefit expected at 60 mg/day range [8,9]

### 2.3 Literature-Based Effect Estimates

From randomized controlled trials of iron supplementation:

| Study Type | Sample Size | Intervention | Ferritin Increase | Duration |
|------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| RCT - 60 mg daily | n=200 | 60 mg elemental iron | +8-15 ng/mL | 12 weeks |
| RCT - Alternate day | n=90 | 60 mg alternate day | +6-12 ng/mL | 12 weeks |
| Cross-sectional | n=1,500 | Self-reported use | +3-8 ng/mL | Mixed |

*Note: Observational studies (NHANES) typically show smaller effects than RCTs due to selection bias, adherence differences, and confounding.*

---

## 3. Expected Effects on Secondary Biomarkers (H4)

### 3.1 Serum Iron

| Expected Effect | Magnitude | Interpretation |
|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
| Geometric mean ratio | 1.1-1.3 | Modest increase in circulating iron |
| Absolute change | +5 to +15 µg/dL | Modest clinical improvement |

*Serum iron is highly variable and influenced by recent intake, making it less reliable than ferritin.*

### 3.2 TIBC (Total Iron Binding Capacity)

| Expected Effect | Magnitude | Interpretation |
|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
| Geometric mean ratio | 0.85-0.95 | **Decrease** in TIBC |
| Absolute change | -20 to -40 µg/dL | Improvement in iron transport |

*Iron deficiency increases TIBC (more transferrin produced). Supplementation should normalize this downward.*

### 3.3 Transferrin Saturation

| Expected Effect | Magnitude | Interpretation |
|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
| Absolute increase | +3 to +8 percentage points | Improved iron availability |
| Relative increase | 20-40% increase | Significant functional improvement |

*Transferrin saturation below 20% indicates iron deficiency; supplementation expected to move values toward normal (20-50%).*

## 4. Expected Multivitamin vs. Dedicated Iron Comparison (H5)

| Comparison | Expected Ferritin Ratio | p-value | Clinical Interpretation |
|------------|------------------------|---------|-------------------------|
| Multivitamin only vs. None | 1.1-1.2 | 0.05-0.10 | Small, marginally significant |
| Dedicated iron vs. Multivitamin | 1.2-1.4 | <0.05 | Moderate, significant |
| Dedicated iron vs. None | 1.4-1.7 | <0.001 | Large, highly significant |

**Expected Conclusion:**
Multivitamins provide insufficient iron dose for meaningful correction of deficiency. Dedicated iron supplements (≥18 mg) required for clinical improvement [10].

---

## 5. Expected Demographic Patterns (H3)

### 5.1 Predicted Regression Coefficients

**Logistic Regression: Predictors of IDWA**

| Predictor | Expected OR | 95% CI | p-value | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------------|--------|---------|----------------|
| Age (per 5 years) | 0.90-0.95 | 0.85-1.00 | <0.05 | Decreasing with age |
| Race (Black vs. White) | 1.5-2.0 | 1.2-2.5 | <0.01 | Higher in Black women |
| Race (Hispanic vs. White) | 1.2-1.5 | 1.0-1.8 | <0.05 | Higher in Hispanic women |
| Poverty ratio (per unit) | 0.85-0.90 | 0.80-0.95 | <0.01 | Lower with higher income |
| BMI (per 5 kg/m²) | 1.0-1.1 | 0.95-1.15 | 0.10-0.30 | Weak/modest association |

### 5.2 Supplement Use Patterns

**Expected Distribution of Iron Supplement Use:**

| Population | Expected % Any Use | Expected % Therapeutic Dose |
|------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Overall women 18-45 | 15-25% | 5-10% |
| Women with IDWA | 25-35% | 15-25% |
| Women with IDA | 40-55% | 30-40% |

*Rationale: Higher use expected among women with diagnosed deficiency (treatment) or preventive awareness.*

| 3-8 ng/mL | Modest | Some individuals benefit |
| 8-15 ng/mL | Meaningful | Many reach normalization |
| >15 ng/mL | Substantial | Majority reach normalization |

### 6.2 Normalization Rates

| Definition of Normalization | Expected Rate with Supplementation | Expected Rate without |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|
| Ferritin ≥15 ng/mL | 35-50% | 15-25% |
| Ferritin ≥25 ng/mL | 15-25% | 5-10% |
| TSAT ≥20% | 40-60% | 20-35% |

### 7.2 Expected Interaction Effects

| Interaction | Expected Direction | Clinical Meaning |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Supplement × Race | Black women show smaller ferritin increase | Higher inflammation, different metabolism |
| Supplement × BMI | Obese women show smaller response | Inflammatory ferritin elevation |
| Supplement × Age | Younger women show stronger response | Greater iron demand |

|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| Prevalence | 2× higher | Broader definition captures more cases |
| Effect size | Smaller (closer to null) | Milder deficiency less responsive |
| Precision | Better (larger sample) | More statistical power |

### 8.2 Inflammation Adjustment (CRP >5 mg/L exclusion)

| Aspect | Expected Finding | Implication |

## 10. Power Analysis Summary

### 10.1 Detectable Effects by Sample Size

Assuming expected sample sizes from NHANES pooling:

| Analysis Group | Expected n | Power | Detectable Effect (Ferritin) |
|----------------|------------|-------|------------------------------|
| Primary (IDWA all) | 800-1,000 | 80% | 3-4 ng/mL difference |
| Supplement users | 200-300 | 80% | 5-7 ng/mL difference |
