## 2. Major NHANES Iron Studies

### 2.1 Physiologically-Based Ferritin Thresholds

#### **Mei et al. (2023)** - "Comparison of Current World Health Organization Guidelines with Physiologically Based Serum Ferritin Thresholds for Iron Deficiency"

**Source**: American Journal of Clinical Nutrition  
**Data**: NHANES III (1988-1994)  
**Population**: Nonpregnant women aged 15-49 years (n=3,697)

**Key Findings:**

| Indicator | Derived Ferritin Threshold | 95% CI |
|-----------|---------------------------|--------|
| Hemoglobin decrease | 24.8 μg/L | 23.2-26.4 |
| eZnPP increase | 22.5 μg/L | 18.6-26.4 |
| **Consensus estimate** | **~25 μg/L** | - |

**Comparison with WHO:**
- WHO threshold for women: <15 μg/L (expert opinion-based)
- Physiologically-based threshold: ~25 μg/L
- **Implication**: WHO threshold identifies iron deficiency at a later stage

**Study Significance:**
- First large US study to derive physiologically-based thresholds using NHANES III
- Provided evidence that iron-deficient erythropoiesis begins at ferritin ~25 μg/L
- Established methodology using hemoglobin and erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin as functional indicators

### 2.2 Prevalence and Risk Factor Studies

#### **Gardner et al. (2011)** - "Iron status and reproduction in US women: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2006"

**Source**: PLoS One  
**Data**: NHANES 1999-2006 (continuous cycles)  
**Population**: Women aged 18-49 years (n=6,264)

**Iron Status Indicators Used:**
- Hemoglobin
- Ferritin
- Soluble transferrin receptor
- % Transferrin saturation

**Key Reproductive Risk Factors Identified:**

| Factor | Association with Iron Status |
|--------|------------------------------|
| **Pregnancy** | Significantly poorer iron status across all indicators |
| **Parity** | All iron biomarkers lower with increasing number of live births |
| **Menstruation** | Regular periods associated with decreased iron levels |
| **Hormonal contraceptives** | Associated with increased iron levels |
| **Age at menarche** | Earlier menarche associated with lower iron |

**Prevalence Estimates (1999-2006):**
- Iron deficiency prevalence varied by definition used
- Reproductive factors significantly associated with iron depletion patterns
- Even in iron-replete US population, reproductive factors drive depletion

**Study Limitations:**
- Did not explicitly report IDWA prevalence separately
- Combined pregnant and non-pregnant women in some analyses
- Earlier NHANES cycles may not reflect current prevalence

---

#### **Cogswell et al. (2009)** - "Assessment of iron status in US pregnant women from NHANES, 1999-2006"

**Source**: American Journal of Clinical Nutrition  
**Data**: NHANES 1999-2006  
**Population**: Pregnant women (n=1,151)

**Key Findings:**
- Overall iron deficiency prevalence (total body iron <0 mg/kg): 18.0% ± 1.4%
- ID increased across trimesters:
  - 1st trimester: 6.9%
  - 2nd trimester: 14.3%
  - 3rd trimester: 29.5%
- Racial disparities: Higher in Mexican American and non-Hispanic Black women
- Parity ≥2 associated with higher ID prevalence

**Relevance to Non-Pregnant IDWA:**
- Demonstrates pregnancy as major risk factor for iron depletion
- Excluding pregnant women from IDWA analyses is appropriate
- Provides benchmark for comparing non-pregnant vs. pregnant iron status

#### **Singh et al. (2015)** - "Identifying factors predicting iron deficiency in US adolescent females using the ferritin and the body iron models"

**Source**: Pediatric Hematology and Oncology  
**Data**: NHANES 2003-2006  
**Population**: Adolescent females aged 12-21 years (n=1,177)

**Prevalence in Adolescents:**
- Ferritin model: 13.1% iron deficiency
- Body iron model: 9.1% iron deficiency
- Anemia screening sensitivity for ID: only 15.6-18.8%

**Risk Factors Identified:**

| Factor | Ferritin Model | Body Iron Model |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Age ≥16 years | Significant | Significant |
| Non-white race | Significant | - |
| Activity level | Significant | - |
| Medroxyprogesterone use | Significant | - |
| Food insecurity | - | Significant |

**Critical Finding:**
- Hemoglobin-based anemia screening misses 80-85% of iron-deficient adolescents
- Supports need for ferritin-based screening regardless of hemoglobin

### 2.3 Recent NHANES Analyses (2015-2023)

#### **Schulz et al. (2023)** - NHANES 2017-2020 Depression and Iron Study

**Source**: CDC Stacks (preliminary analysis)  
**Data**: NHANES 2017-2020  
**Population**: Young adults aged 18-25 years

**Key Findings on Sex Differences:**

| Outcome | Females | Males |
|---------|---------|-------|
| PHQ-9 depression prevalence | 12.5% | 6.8% |
| Ferritin deficiency association with depression | OR = 0.34 (lower odds) | OR = 14.13 (higher odds) |

**Paradoxical Female Finding:**
- Females with ferritin deficiency had **lower** odds of depression
- Potential explanations:
  - Higher baseline ID prevalence in females (normative)
  - Different symptom expression by sex
  - Need for sex-specific ferritin thresholds

**Study Relevance:**
- Highlights complexity of ID-symptom relationships
- Suggests need for sex-stratified analyses
- Demonstrates importance of examining non-anemic iron deficiency

### 2.4 Comprehensive Meta-Analyses Using NHANES Data

#### **Hamarsha et al. (2025)** - "Prevalence of iron deficiency with or without anemia in adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis"

**Source**: Blood (ASH Abstracts)  
**Data**: Meta-analysis including NHANES studies (n=527,746 total across 71 studies)  
**US-specific data from NHANES included**

**Prevalence by Ferritin Threshold (Premenopausal Females):**

| Threshold | Pooled Prevalence | 95% CI |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| <15 μg/L | 19% | 19-20% |
| <30 μg/L | 49% | 49-50% |
| <50 μg/L | 70% | 70-71% |

**Key Insights:**
- Dramatic prevalence increase with higher thresholds
- Premenopausal women at substantially higher risk than males or postmenopausal women
- Current WHO guidelines likely underestimate true burden

## 3. NHANES Methodological Considerations

### 3.1 Sampling and Weighting

**Complex Survey Design:**
- Stratified, multistage probability sampling
- Oversampling of specific populations (e.g., Black, Hispanic, low-income)
- **Requirement**: Use of survey weights for representative estimates
- **Requirement**: Account for clustering and stratification in variance estimation

**Key Weights for Analysis:**
- `WTMEC2YR`: Full sample MEC examination weight (2-year)
- `WTMEC4YR`: 4-year combined weight
- `SDMVSTRA`: Stratum variable
- `SDMVPSU`: PSU (cluster) variable

### 3.2 Ferritin Measurement Methods

**NHANES Ferritin Assay History:**
- Different assay platforms across survey cycles
- Early cycles: Radioimmunoassays
- Later cycles: Immunoturbidimetric methods
- Some variation in reference ranges across cycles

**Inflammation Adjustment:**
- CRP available for inflammation adjustment
- WHO recommendation: Ferritin <15 μg/L if CRP <5 mg/L; <70 μg/L if CRP ≥5 mg/L
- Petry et al. (2022) suggest threshold adjustment may not be necessary in healthy populations

### 3.3 Pregnancy Status

**NHANES Pregnancy Data:**
- Pregnancy status determined by questionnaire and urinalysis
- Pregnant women oversampled in some cycles
- **Critical**: Separate analyses for pregnant vs. non-pregnant women
- Our study: Exclude pregnant women to focus on IDWA

### 3.4 Strengths of NHANES for IDWA Research

1. **Nationally representative**: Findings generalizable to US population
2. **Standardized laboratory methods**: Consistent biomarker measurement
3. **Comprehensive covariates**: Demographics, diet, health behaviors
4. **Large sample sizes**: Adequate power for subgroup analyses
5. **Longitudinal cycles**: Can examine trends over time
6. **Publicly available**: Reproducible research

### 3.5 Limitations of NHANES for IDWA Research

1. **Cross-sectional design**: Cannot establish causality
2. **Single ferritin measurement**: Does not capture intraindividual variation
3. **No symptom data**: NHANES lacks validated fatigue/cognitive assessments
4. **Cycle-specific limitations**: Not all variables available in all cycles
5. **Survival bias**: Excludes institutionalized and severely ill populations
6. **No treatment data**: Cannot assess supplementation effects

## 7. Key NHANES-Based Research Contributions

### 7.1 Threshold Derivation Studies

The NHANES-based physiologically-based threshold studies (Mei 2023, Petry 2022, Schrimpe 2024) represent the most significant recent contributions to IDWA research:

**Impact:**
- Challenge WHO <15 μg/L guideline
- Provide evidence-based alternative (~25 μg/L)
- Support clinical guideline revision
- Methodology can be replicated in other populations

### 7.2 Prevalence and Trends

NHANES provides the only nationally-representative US data on iron status:

**Impact:**
- Track population-level changes over time
- Identify high-risk subgroups
- Evaluate public health interventions
- Inform resource allocation

### 7.3 Risk Factor Identification

## 8. Conclusions

NHANES data provide an unparalleled resource for understanding iron deficiency without anemia in US women of reproductive age. Key takeaways from NHANES-based research include:

1. **Prevalence is substantial**: 15-20% at WHO threshold; 40-50% at higher physiologically-based thresholds

2. **Current thresholds underestimate ID**: Physiologically-based evidence supports ~25 μg/L threshold vs. WHO <15 μg/L

3. **Reproductive factors dominate**: Menstruation, parity, and pregnancy are primary determinants of iron status

4. **Disparities exist**: Racial/ethnic and socioeconomic differences in iron status require attention

5. **Screening inadequate**: Anemia-based screening misses majority of iron-deficient women

### Implications for Our Study

Using NHANES 2015-2020 data, we can:
- Quantify current IDWA prevalence in US women aged 18-45
- Characterize biomarker distributions
- Identify risk factors and high-risk subgroups
- Examine thresholds and diagnostic criteria
- Provide updated population estimates

This NHANES-based foundation will inform clinical practice, public health policy, and future research directions for addressing iron deficiency without anemia in women.
