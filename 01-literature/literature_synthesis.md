## Executive Summary

Iron deficiency without anemia (IDWA) represents a significant yet underdiagnosed condition affecting women of reproductive age. Current evidence indicates that 10-20% of menstruating women have iron deficiency, with prevalence varying dramatically based on diagnostic thresholds used. While the WHO recommends serum ferritin <15 μg/L as the diagnostic cutoff, recent physiologically-based studies using NHANES data suggest that iron-deficient erythropoiesis begins at ferritin levels around 25 μg/L. Iron supplementation has demonstrated consistent benefits for reducing fatigue in non-anemic iron-deficient women, with optimal dosing strategies now favoring lower, less frequent dosing to improve tolerability while maintaining efficacy.

## 1. Iron Deficiency Without Anemia (IDWA) Definition and Prevalence

### 1.1 Diagnostic Criteria and Thresholds

**WHO Guidelines (2020)**
- Serum ferritin <15 μg/L for adults (based on expert opinion)
- Threshold derived from older radiometric assays

**Physiologically-Based Thresholds (2018-2024)**
Recent NHANES-based studies have challenged the WHO threshold:
- **Petry et al. (2022)**: Threshold of ~25 μg/L identified using sTfR and hemoglobin indicators
- **Mei et al. (2023)**: NHANES III analysis showing thresholds of 22.5-24.8 μg/L for women
- **Schrimpe et al. (2024)**: Serial NHANES cross-sectional study confirming ~25 μg/L threshold
- **Mauracher et al. (2025)**: Hemoglobin decline begins at ferritin <28.5 μg/L

**Clinical Implications**
- Using WHO <15 μg/L threshold significantly underestimates ID prevalence
- At <30 μg/L threshold, prevalence is 2-3 times higher than at <15 μg/L
- Iron-deficient erythropoiesis begins well before anemia develops

### 1.2 Prevalence in Women of Reproductive Age

**Global and US Prevalence Data**

| Ferritin Threshold | Prevalence in Premenopausal Women | Source |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|--------|
| <15 μg/L (WHO) | 18-19% | Mauracher et al., 2025 |
| <25 μg/L (Physiological) | 36% | Kumar et al., 2024 |
| <30 μg/L | 45.8% | Mauracher et al., 2025 |
| <50 μg/L | 49-70% | Hamarsha et al., 2025 |

**Key Findings:**
- **Auerbach et al. (2025)**: Approximately 38% of nonpregnant reproductive-age women in the US have ID without anemia; 13% have IDA
- **Hamarsha et al. (2025) Meta-analysis**: 
  - At <15 μg/L: 19% prevalence in premenopausal women
  - At <30 μg/L: 49% prevalence
  - At <50 μg/L: 70% prevalence
- **Morgan et al. (2025)**: 30% of patients have IDWA with ferritin between lab LLN and 30 ng/mL; 88% were adult women

### 1.3 Risk Factors

**Primary Risk Factors for IDWA:**
1. **Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB)**: Major contributor affecting ~30% of women
2. **Parity**: Each pregnancy depletes iron stores; increasing parity associated with lower ferritin
3. **Breastfeeding history**: Alsubaie et al. (2026) found breastfeeding history strongly associated with ID (adjusted OR = 6.72)
4. **Previous anemia history**: Alsubaie et al. (2026) showed adjusted OR = 4.92 for ID
5. **Dietary factors**: Low iron intake, vegetarian/vegan diets
6. **Age**: Women aged 35-49 at higher risk than 18-24
7. **Race/Ethnicity**: Non-Hispanic Black women at highest risk (19% IDA prevalence vs. 3.8% in non-Hispanic White women)

**Socioeconomic Factors:**
- Lower education level (inverse association)
- Lower poverty-income ratio
- Food insecurity
- Obesity paradoxically associated with higher IDA risk

## 2. Iron Supplementation Effects

### 2.1 Impact on Ferritin Levels

**Dose-Response Relationships**

| Study | Dose | Duration | Ferritin Increase |
|-------|------|----------|-------------------|
| Vaucher et al., 2012 | 80 mg/day | 12 weeks | +11.4 μg/L |
| Verdon et al., 2003 | 80 mg/day | 4 weeks | Significant increase |
| Keller et al., 2020 (IV) | 800 mg | Single | +114.2 μg/L |
| Karregat et al., 2025 (FORTE) | 60 mg/day | 56 days | OR 0.52 for low ferritin |
| Stoel et al., 2023 | 100 mg AD | 180 days | 44.8 μg/L median |

**Key Findings:**
- **Karregat et al. (2025) FORTE Trial**: 60 mg daily iron supplementation was most effective strategy for ferritin repletion (OR = 0.52 for low ferritin at 56 days)
- **Vaucher et al. (2012)**: Ferritin increased by 6.8 μg/L at 6 weeks and 11.4 μg/L at 12 weeks with 80 mg/day iron
- **Repletion time**: Significant ferritin increases observed as early as 2-6 weeks; near-normalization typically by 12 weeks with consistent supplementation

### 2.2 Dosing Strategies: Daily vs. Alternate Day

**Recent Evidence on Optimal Dosing:**

**Stoel et al. (2023)** - Landmark RCT findings:
- **Alternate-day vs. consecutive-day (100 mg)**: Comparable ferritin levels at 6 months (43.8 vs. 44.8 μg/L)
- **Advantage**: Alternate-day dosing had 56% fewer GI side effects and lower hepcidin levels
- **Fractional iron absorption**: Higher with alternate-day dosing (5.5% vs. 4.1%)

**Karregat et al. (2025) FORTE Trial**:
- Compared 0 mg (placebo), 30 mg, and 60 mg elemental iron on daily vs. alternate-day schedules
- 60 mg daily most effective for mitigating iron deficiency, low Hb, and especially low ferritin
- No increase in GI discomfort with 60 mg daily vs. placebo

**Practical Recommendations:**
- **Daily dosing (60 mg)**: Most effective for rapid ferritin repletion
- **Alternate-day dosing**: Comparable efficacy with fewer side effects; suitable for maintenance or sensitive patients
- **Lower doses (30 mg)**: Effective but slower repletion

### 2.3 Impact on Iron Biomarkers

**Consistent Biomarker Changes with Supplementation:**

| Biomarker | Direction | Magnitude |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Ferritin | ↑ | +11.4 μg/L at 12 weeks (Vaucher) |
| Hemoglobin | ↑ | +0.32 g/dL at 12 weeks (Vaucher) |
| sTfR | ↓ | -0.54 mg/L at 12 weeks (Vaucher) |
| Iron Saturation | ↑ | Variable |
| TIBC | ↓ | Variable |

## 3. Symptoms of Iron Deficiency Without Anemia

### 3.1 Fatigue

**Evidence Summary:**

**Randomized Controlled Trials:**
1. **Verdon et al. (2003)** - Landmark BMJ study:
   - 144 non-anemic women with unexplained fatigue
   - Iron group: 29% reduction in fatigue vs. 13% with placebo
   - Benefit restricted to women with ferritin ≤50 μg/L

2. **Vaucher et al. (2012)** - CMAJ RCT:
   - 198 non-anemic menstruating women with ferritin <50 μg/L
   - Fatigue decreased 47.7% in iron group vs. 28.8% placebo (p=0.02)
   - Mean difference: -18.9% (95% CI -34.5 to -3.2)

3. **Keller et al. (2020)** - IV Iron RCT:
   - 405 non-anemic blood donors with ferritin ≤50 μg/L
   - Ferritin increased by 114.2 μg/L
   - **No significant improvement in fatigue** despite biochemical improvement
   - Suggests threshold effect or non-iron causes of fatigue

**Meta-Analyses:**
- **Houston et al. (2018)**: Meta-analysis of 6 RCTs showed SMD -0.38 (95% CI -0.52 to -0.23) reduction in fatigue with iron supplementation
- **Devi et al. (2017)**: Meta-analysis showed pooled effect size 0.33 (p<0.001) for iron therapy improving fatigue in IDNA

**Key Insights:**
- Iron supplementation consistently reduces subjective fatigue in IDWA
- Effect size is moderate but clinically meaningful
- Benefits may be limited to those with lower baseline ferritin (≤50 μg/L)
- Objective measures of fatigue may not always correlate with subjective improvement

### 3.2 Cognitive Function

**Evidence Summary:**

**Bruner et al. (1996)** - Seminal Lancet Study:
- 81 non-anemic iron-deficient adolescent girls (mean ferritin ~5 μg/L)
- Iron supplementation improved verbal learning and memory
- Effect most pronounced in those with lowest baseline ferritin

**Additional Studies:**
- **Mu et al. (2019)**: Iron deficiency without anemia impairs cognitive function in premenopausal women
- Cognitive domains affected: attention, memory, psychomotor speed, academic performance
- Iron repletion associated with cognitive improvement in most studies

### 3.3 Exercise Performance

**Evidence Summary:**

**Heden et al. (2015)**:
- Iron-deficient non-anemic athletes
- Iron supplementation improved oxygen utilization and aerobic capacity

**Houston et al. (2018) Meta-analysis**:
- **No significant improvement** in objective measures of physical capacity (VO2max, timed exercise tests)
- Despite subjective fatigue improvement, objective exercise performance may not improve

**Hinton et al. (2000)**:
- Iron-depleted non-anemic women
- Iron supplementation improved endurance after training

**Hencken et al. (2017)**:
- Case series of young women with IDWA
- Symptoms included exercise intolerance, reduced athletic performance

**Clinical Implication:**
- Iron supplementation improves subjective energy and may improve exercise tolerance
- Benefits on maximal performance metrics inconsistent
- Most relevant for recreational athletes and active women experiencing fatigue

### 3.4 Quality of Life

**Findings:**
- Vaucher et al. (2012): No significant effect on quality of life (p=0.2)
- **BUT**: Fatigue improvement indirectly improves daily functioning
- Heavy menstrual bleeding with ID negatively impacts absenteeism and presenteeism
- Iron deficiency in pregnancy associated with reduced quality of life measures

### 3.5 Other Symptoms

**Associated with IDWA:**
- **Restless legs syndrome**: Present in 32-40% of iron-deficient individuals
- **Pagophagia (ice craving)**: Strongly associated with ID; 40% of ID patients in some studies
- **Pica**: Non-nutritive cravings (clay, dirt, starch) in 40-50%
- **Hair loss and brittle nails**: Common complaints
- **Dyspnea and lightheadedness**: Exercise-related symptoms
- **Depression and irritability**: Mood disturbances reported

## 4. Women's Health Context

### 4.1 Menstrual Blood Loss Impact

**Key Findings:**

**Mauracher et al. (2024)**:
- Menstrual blood loss is an independent determinant of hemoglobin and ferritin
- MBL accounted for 8% of explained variance in both Hb and ferritin
- Heavy menstrual bleeding (PBAC ≥150) associated with anemia (OR = 3.56)

**Physiology:**
- Normal menstruation: ~1 mg iron loss/day (balanced by 18 mg/day dietary intake)
- HMB (>80 mL/cycle): Exceeds compensatory capacity
- Chronic blood loss leads to sequential depletion: iron stores → IDWA → IDA

**Kouides et al. (2009) and Related Studies:**
- Women with HMB require systematic iron assessment
- Current guidelines inconsistent: only 3 of 22 guidelines recommend routine ferritin screening

### 4.2 Reproductive Age Considerations (18-45)

**Age-Related Patterns:**
- Peak risk: Ages 35-49 (higher parity, cumulative menstrual losses)
- Adolescents (12-21): 13.1% ID prevalence (ferritin model); anemia screening misses 85% of cases
- Reproductive years characterized by:
  - Regular menstrual blood loss
  - Potential pregnancy and lactation
  - Higher iron requirements

**Gardner et al. (2011) NHANES Analysis:**
- Menstruation associated with decreased iron indicators
- Hormonal contraceptives associated with increased iron levels
- Parity inversely associated with all iron biomarkers

### 4.3 Pregnancy Exclusion Rationale

**Rationale for Excluding Pregnant Women from IDWA Studies:**

1. **Different Physiological State**:
   - Pregnancy causes physiological anemia (hemodilution)
   - Iron requirements increase dramatically (≥27 mg/day vs. 18 mg/day)
   - Ferritin naturally declines across trimesters

2. **Different Diagnostic Thresholds**:
   - Tang et al. (2019): 91.3% of pregnant women iron deficient by ferritin <50 μg/L
   - Fein et al. (2024): 89% of pregnant women had ferritin <30 μg/L at 23-29 weeks
   - Trimester-specific thresholds needed (e.g., <25.8 μg/L first trimester, <18.3 μg/L second)

3. **Different Treatment Approaches**:
   - Universal iron supplementation recommended in pregnancy
   - IV iron more commonly used for moderate-severe deficiency
   - Fetal considerations change risk-benefit calculations

4. **Study Design Considerations**:
   - Pregnant women require separate analyses
   - Mixed populations confound results
   - Pregnancy is an exclusion criterion in most IDWA RCTs

## 5. Gaps in Current Evidence

### 5.1 Diagnostic Threshold Uncertainty
- Optimal ferritin threshold for IDWA remains debated (15 vs. 30 vs. 50 μg/L)
- Assay standardization issues across platforms
- Inflammation correction protocols not standardized

### 5.2 Treatment Protocols
- Long-term outcomes of iron supplementation in IDWA unclear
- Optimal duration of therapy not established
- Recurrence rates after successful repletion unknown

### 5.3 Symptom Thresholds
- Ferritin level at which symptoms appear varies by individual
- Relationship between ferritin and specific symptoms (cognitive, exercise) needs clarification
- Predictors of treatment response not well characterized

### 5.4 Population-Specific Data
- Limited data in non-White populations
- Geographic variation in prevalence understudied
- Socioeconomic factors need more investigation

## 6. Key Clinical Recommendations from Literature

### 6.1 Screening
1. **Screen women of reproductive age with fatigue** regardless of hemoglobin
2. **Use ferritin as primary screening tool** (not hemoglobin alone)
3. **Consider threshold of <30 μg/L** for heightened sensitivity
4. **Screen women with heavy menstrual bleeding** routinely

### 6.2 Diagnosis
1. **IDWA diagnosis**: Ferritin <15-30 μg/L with normal hemoglobin
2. **Consider symptoms** in diagnostic algorithm
3. **Evaluate for HMB** in all IDWA cases
4. **Assess dietary intake** and risk factors

### 6.3 Treatment
1. **Oral iron first-line**: 60-80 mg elemental iron daily
2. **Alternate-day dosing**: Consider for GI sensitivity
3. **Duration**: Minimum 3 months to replete stores; 6 months total common
4. **Reassess**: Check ferritin at 6-12 weeks
5. **IV iron**: Reserve for intolerance, malabsorption, or severe deficiency

### 6.4 Monitoring
1. **Follow-up ferritin** at 6-12 weeks
2. **Hemoglobin** if borderline or symptoms persist
3. **Symptom assessment** using validated scales
4. **Address ongoing losses** (e.g., HMB treatment)

## 8. Conclusions

Iron deficiency without anemia represents a prevalent and clinically significant condition affecting women of reproductive age. Current evidence supports:

1. **Higher diagnostic thresholds** than WHO recommendations, with physiologically-based evidence supporting ~25 μg/L as the onset of iron-deficient erythropoiesis

2. **Substantial symptom burden** including fatigue, cognitive impairment, and reduced exercise tolerance that responds to iron supplementation

3. **Effective treatment** with oral iron (60-80 mg daily or alternate-day) leading to ferritin repletion within 12 weeks and fatigue reduction

4. **Heavy menstrual bleeding** as a primary modifiable risk factor requiring systematic screening and concurrent management

5. **Need for improved awareness** among clinicians to recognize IDWA as a distinct clinical entity requiring evaluation and treatment beyond anemia-focused screening

This literature synthesis provides the foundation for designing NHANES-based research to quantify IDWA prevalence, identify risk factors, and characterize the relationship between iron biomarkers and symptoms in US women of reproductive age.
