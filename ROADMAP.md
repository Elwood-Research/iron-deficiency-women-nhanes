# Study Roadmap

## Phase 1: Literature Review
**Timeline**: Days 1-3
**Deliverable**: 15+ verified references in `01-literature/`
**Key Topics**:
- Iron deficiency without anemia prevalence and clinical significance
- Ferritin as biomarker of iron status
- Iron supplementation effects on ferritin
- NHANES iron studies in women
- Iron deficiency symptoms in non-anemic individuals

## Phase 2: Research Plan
**Timeline**: Days 4-5
**Deliverable**: `02-research-plan/` with hypotheses and analysis plan
**Key Components**:
- Primary and secondary hypotheses
- Variable operationalization
- Statistical approach overview

## Phase 3: Methods Development
**Timeline**: Days 6-8
**Deliverable**: `03-methods/` with detailed methodology
**Key Components**:
- NHANES data structure documentation
- Study population inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Variable definitions and derivations
- Statistical analysis plan with survey weights
- Sensitivity analyses plan

## Phase 4: Data Analysis
**Timeline**: Days 9-14
**Deliverable**: `04-analysis/` with scripts and outputs
**Key Components**:
- Data merging and cleaning scripts
- Descriptive statistics
- Prevalence estimates (weighted)
- Regression analyses
- Tables and figures (300 DPI PNGs)
- Results summary

## Phase 5: Synthesis
**Timeline**: Days 15-17
**Deliverable**: `05-conclusion/` with discussion
**Key Components**:
- Results interpretation
- Literature comparison
- Limitations assessment
- Clinical implications
- Future research directions

## Phase 6: Manuscript Preparation
**Timeline**: Days 18-22
**Deliverable**: `manuscript/` with LaTeX and PDF
**Key Components**:
- Title, abstract, keywords
- Introduction with literature context
- Methods section
- Results with tables/figures
- Discussion
- Conclusion
- References

## Phase 7: GitHub Publication
**Timeline**: Day 23
**Deliverable**: Published repository at Elwood-Research/
**Steps**:
1. Final review of all files
2. Initialize git
3. Create GitHub repo
4. Push all files
5. Verify public access

## Critical Path Dependencies
- Literature review → Research plan (hypothesis refinement)
- Methods → Analysis (variable definitions)
- Analysis → Synthesis (results needed)
- Synthesis → Manuscript (interpretation needed)
- All phases → Publication (final assembly)

## Risk Mitigation
- **Missing data**: Plan sensitivity analyses
- **Small IDWA sample**: Pool multiple NHANES cycles
- **Pregnancy variable uncertainty**: Search all relevant datasets
- **Complex survey design**: Ensure proper weighting and variance estimation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 15+ literature references with NHANES-specific studies
- [ ] Clear, testable hypotheses
- [ ] Valid statistical approach accounting for complex survey design
- [ ] Complete analysis with reproducible scripts
- [ ] Publication-quality tables and figures
- [ ] Comprehensive discussion of findings
- [ ] Compiled LaTeX manuscript ≥8 pages
- [ ] Public GitHub repository
