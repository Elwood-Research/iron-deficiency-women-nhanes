# Discussion: Iron Deficiency Without Anemia in US Women of Reproductive Age

## Summary of Key Findings

This nationally representative study of 6,125 non-pregnant women aged 18-45 years in the United States reveals that iron deficiency without anemia (IDWA) affects approximately 9.0% (95% CI: 8.3%-9.7%) of this population when applying the World Health Organization (WHO) ferritin threshold of <15 μg/L. Our analysis yields three principal findings with significant clinical and public health implications. First, the prevalence of IDWA varies substantially by demographic characteristics, with Mexican American women experiencing the highest rates (11.6%), followed by non-Hispanic White women (8.8%) and non-Hispanic Black women (6.5%). Age-related patterns show peak prevalence among women aged 36-40 years (10.3%), suggesting cumulative iron depletion effects across the reproductive lifespan. Second, iron supplementation demonstrates a statistically significant association with higher ferritin levels in fully adjusted models (β=0.062, p=0.048), corresponding to approximately 6.4% higher ferritin concentrations among supplement users compared to non-users. This effect persists after controlling for demographic factors, socioeconomic variables, dietary patterns, and health behaviors. Third, our dose-response analysis reveals that moderate-dose iron supplementation (18-27 mg/day) exhibits the strongest association with ferritin levels (β=0.207, p<0.001), surpassing both lower doses (1-17 mg/day) and higher doses (≥28 mg/day). This unexpected finding suggests potential optimal dosing ranges that warrant further investigation. With approximately 2.5 million US women affected by IDWA based on these prevalence estimates, and 18.5% of the population currently using iron supplements, these findings underscore the substantial public health burden and the need for evidence-based screening and treatment strategies.

## Comparison with Literature

### Prevalence Estimates and Diagnostic Thresholds

Our observed IDWA prevalence of 9.0% (95% CI: 8.3%-9.7%) aligns with the lower bound of estimates reported in recent meta-analyses while highlighting the critical influence of diagnostic thresholds on prevalence calculations. The landmark meta-analysis by Hamarsha et al. (2025) reported a pooled prevalence of 19% (95% CI: 19-20%) for iron deficiency at the <15 μg/L threshold among premenopausal women, nearly double our observed estimate. This discrepancy may reflect several factors: temporal trends in iron status, differences in population demographics, or variations in laboratory methodologies across studies. Importantly, Hamarsha et al. demonstrated the dramatic sensitivity of prevalence estimates to threshold selection, reporting 49% prevalence at <30 μg/L and 70% at <50 μg/L thresholds. These findings underscore that our 9.0% estimate using the WHO <15 μg/L threshold likely represents a conservative lower bound, with the true burden of iron depletion potentially affecting 35-40% of women when employing physiologically-based thresholds around 25 μg/L.

The physiologically-based threshold literature provides crucial context for interpreting our findings. Petry et al. (2022), in their analysis combining the REDS-RISE donor study with NHANES 2003-2018 validation data, identified a threshold of approximately 25 μg/L using soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) and hemoglobin indicators. Their NHANES validation cohort demonstrated sTfR-based thresholds of 25.5 μg/L and hemoglobin-based thresholds of 26.6 μg/L—remarkably consistent across donor and general population samples. This convergence supports the generalizability of the ~25 μg/L threshold to our study population and suggests that the WHO <15 μg/L guideline may identify iron deficiency only at a relatively advanced stage of depletion. Similarly, Mei et al. (2023), analyzing NHANES III data from 3,697 non-pregnant women aged 15-49 years, derived consensus thresholds of 22.5-24.8 μg/L using hemoglobin decrease and erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin elevation as functional indicators. Schrimpe et al. (2024) extended these findings through serial NHANES cross-sectional analyses (2003-2006, 2007-2010, 2015-2018, 2017-March 2020), confirming threshold stability at approximately 25 μg/L across multiple survey cycles and demonstrating temporal consistency of physiologically-based estimates.

The clinical implications of threshold selection extend beyond prevalence estimation to treatment decisions and public health resource allocation. Auerbach et al. (2025), in their comprehensive review, estimated that approximately 38% of non-pregnant reproductive-age women in the US have iron deficiency without anemia—a figure substantially higher than our 9.0% estimate and consistent with the higher thresholds proposed by physiologically-based studies. This three-to-four-fold difference in estimated prevalence has profound implications: at the WHO <15 μg/L threshold, IDWA affects approximately 2.5 million US women, whereas at a <25-30 μg/L threshold, the affected population expands to 10-12 million women. Our findings support calls for threshold reevaluation and suggest that current guidelines may underestimate the true population burden by 50-70%.

### Iron Supplementation Effects: Clinical Trial Evidence

Our finding of a 6.4% higher ferritin level among supplement users (β=0.062, p=0.048), while statistically significant, appears modest when compared to effect sizes reported in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of iron supplementation. This discrepancy highlights fundamental differences between observational association and experimental intervention, as well as potential limitations in our measurement of supplement use. The landmark RCT by Vaucher et al. (2012), which randomized 198 non-anemic menstruating women with ferritin <50 μg/L to 80 mg/day iron or placebo for 12 weeks, demonstrated substantially larger effects: ferritin increased by 6.8 μg/L at 6 weeks and 11.4 μg/L at 12 weeks in the iron group compared to placebo. Verdon et al. (2003), in their seminal BMJ study of 144 non-anemic women with unexplained fatigue, similarly reported significant ferritin increases with 80 mg/day iron supplementation over 4 weeks, alongside a 29% reduction in fatigue compared to 13% with placebo.

Several factors may explain the smaller effect size observed in our observational study. First, cross-sectional measurement cannot capture temporal dynamics: we cannot determine whether supplement users initiated supplementation due to documented deficiency (which would show higher baseline ferritin due to treatment effect) or for prophylactic reasons. Second, self-reported supplement use is subject to measurement error, including inaccurate recall, variability in supplement composition, and uncertainty regarding duration and adherence. Third, our analysis captures average effects across diverse baseline ferritin levels, whereas RCTs typically enroll participants with documented deficiency (ferritin <50 μg/L), where treatment effects are maximized. Fourth, supplement users in our sample may represent a healthier, more health-conscious population with different baseline iron status than the general population.

The Karregat et al. (2025) FORTE trial provides the most relevant comparison for understanding optimal dosing strategies. This randomized trial compared 0 mg (placebo), 30 mg, and 60 mg elemental iron administered on daily versus alternate-day schedules among iron-deficient women. The investigators found that 60 mg daily iron supplementation represented the most effective strategy for ferritin repletion, with an odds ratio of 0.52 (95% CI: 0.33-0.83) for low ferritin at 56 days compared to placebo. Importantly, the 60 mg daily regimen showed no increase in gastrointestinal discomfort compared to placebo, challenging conventional assumptions about dose-related side effects. These findings support our observation of significant supplementation effects, though our effect estimate is attenuated by observational design and measurement limitations.

### Dose-Response Relationships and Optimal Dosing

Our dose-response analysis revealing strongest effects at moderate doses (18-27 mg/day, β=0.207, p<0.001) initially appears paradoxical given the FORTE trial's findings favoring higher 60 mg doses. However, several explanations reconcile these observations. First, the moderate dose category in our analysis (18-27 mg) aligns closely with standard over-the-counter prenatal and women's multivitamin formulations, which typically contain 18-27 mg elemental iron and may represent chronic, sustained use patterns. In contrast, higher dose supplements (≥28 mg) may indicate intermittent use, prescription iron for documented deficiency with subsequent discontinuation, or shorter durations that limit cumulative effect detection in cross-sectional data.

Stoel et al. (2023) provided landmark evidence on alternate-day versus consecutive-day dosing strategies in their randomized trial comparing 100 mg iron administered on alternate-day versus consecutive-day schedules over 180 days. Their findings demonstrated comparable ferritin levels at 6 months (43.8 μg/L alternate-day versus 44.8 μg/L consecutive-day), but with 56% fewer gastrointestinal side effects and lower hepcidin levels in the alternate-day group. Fractional iron absorption was higher with alternate-day dosing (5.5% versus 4.1%), suggesting that less frequent dosing may improve tolerability without sacrificing efficacy. These findings have important implications for interpreting our dose-response results: the moderate-dose group may represent optimal adherence and tolerability patterns that maximize long-term bioavailability, whereas higher-dose users may experience decreased adherence due to side effects.

The concept of hepcidin-mediated absorption blocking provides mechanistic insight into our observed dose-response pattern. High-dose iron administration acutely elevates hepcidin levels, which suppress intestinal iron absorption for 24-48 hours. Consequently, split-dose or alternate-day strategies may achieve superior cumulative absorption compared to daily high-dose regimens, despite lower per-dose quantities. Our finding that moderate doses show the strongest association may reflect this biological reality: 18-27 mg daily may represent a "sweet spot" that elevates iron status without triggering substantial hepcidin-mediated absorption inhibition, enabling consistent daily use with good tolerability.

### Demographic Patterns and Health Disparities

Our finding of highest IDWA prevalence among Mexican American women (11.6%) aligns with established disparities in iron status documented in NHANES-based studies. Cogswell et al. (2009), analyzing NHANES 1999-2006 data from 1,151 pregnant women, reported higher iron deficiency prevalence among Mexican American and non-Hispanic Black women compared to non-Hispanic White women, with parity and socioeconomic factors contributing to observed disparities. Gardner et al. (2011), in their comprehensive analysis of NHANES 1999-2006 data from 6,264 women aged 18-49 years, identified race/ethnicity as a significant predictor of iron biomarker levels, with dietary patterns, parity, and healthcare access mediating observed differences. Our observation of lower IDWA prevalence among non-Hispanic Black women (6.5%) compared to non-Hispanic White women (8.8%) appears counterintuitive given prior reports of higher anemia prevalence among Black women. However, this pattern may reflect complex interactions between iron deficiency and anemia etiologies, including higher rates of hemoglobinopathies and chronic inflammation that affect hemoglobin independent of iron status.

The age-related pattern showing peak IDWA prevalence among women aged 36-40 years (10.3%) supports the cumulative iron depletion hypothesis articulated in the literature. Mauracher et al. (2024) demonstrated that menstrual blood loss accounts for approximately 8% of explained variance in both hemoglobin and ferritin levels, with heavy menstrual bleeding (PBAC ≥150) associated with three-fold increased odds of anemia. Across the reproductive lifespan, cumulative menstrual losses compound with parity-related iron depletion to produce highest deficiency risk in the later reproductive years. Our mean sample age of 32.1 years places the majority of participants in the period of escalating deficiency risk, with women aged 36-40 representing the vanguard of cumulative depletion effects.

## Clinical and Public Health Implications

### Population Impact and Burden Estimation

Applying our observed 9.0% IDWA prevalence to the US population of non-pregnant women aged 18-45 years (approximately 28 million women based on Census Bureau estimates) suggests that 2.5 million women are affected by IDWA using the WHO <15 μg/L threshold. However, if we apply the physiologically-based threshold of <25 μg/L supported by Petry et al. (2022), Mei et al. (2023), and Schrimpe et al. (2024), the affected population likely expands to 10-12 million women—a four-fold increase with profound implications for healthcare resource allocation and public health prioritization. This expanded estimate aligns with Auerbach et al.'s (2025) estimate that 38% of non-pregnant reproductive-age women have iron deficiency without anemia, suggesting that current screening and treatment paradigms based on WHO thresholds capture only a fraction of the true disease burden.

The symptom burden associated with IDWA amplifies its public health significance beyond mere prevalence estimates. Vaucher et al. (2012) demonstrated a 47.7% reduction in fatigue with iron supplementation compared to 28.8% with placebo—a 18.9 percentage point difference (95% CI: 3.2-34.5) representing substantial quality-of-life improvement. Verdon et al. (2003) similarly reported 29% fatigue reduction with iron versus 13% with placebo among non-anemic women with ferritin ≤50 μg/L. Houston et al. (2018), in their meta-analysis of 6 RCTs, calculated a standardized mean difference of -0.38 (95% CI: -0.52 to -0.23) for fatigue reduction with iron supplementation. Applied to our estimated 2.5-12 million affected women, these effect sizes suggest that evidence-based iron supplementation could meaningfully improve symptoms for hundreds of thousands to millions of US women currently without access to diagnosis or treatment.

### Threshold Reconsideration and Screening Implications

Our findings, contextualized within the broader literature, support reconsideration of the WHO <15 μg/L ferritin threshold for diagnosing IDWA. The physiologically-based evidence from multiple NHANES analyses consistently identifies ~25 μg/L as the threshold at which iron-deficient erythropoiesis begins, with implications for clinical decision-making. Women with ferritin levels between 15-25 μg/L—classified as "normal" by current WHO guidelines—may experience subtle but clinically meaningful impairments in oxygen transport, exercise tolerance, and cognitive function that could respond to iron supplementation.

Clinical guidelines currently vary in their recommendations regarding ferritin thresholds. Kouides et al. (2009) and related studies on heavy menstrual bleeding found that only 3 of 22 clinical guidelines recommend routine ferritin screening, with most focusing exclusively on hemoglobin-based anemia detection. Morgan et al. (2025) reported that 30% of patients presenting with IDWA have ferritin levels between the laboratory lower limit of normal and 30 ng/mL, with 88% being adult women—highlighting the substantial population of women with suboptimal iron status despite "normal" laboratory values. Our findings support calls for expanded ferritin screening, particularly among women with fatigue, heavy menstrual bleeding, or other symptoms suggestive of iron deficiency regardless of hemoglobin status.

The cost-effectiveness of expanded screening remains an important consideration. While serum ferritin testing adds incremental cost compared to hemoglobin screening alone, the potential benefits of early detection and treatment—including reduced fatigue, improved work productivity, and prevention of progression to iron deficiency anemia—may justify expanded testing. Future research should explicitly evaluate cost-effectiveness of various screening strategies, including targeted screening of high-risk groups (women with heavy menstrual bleeding, multiparous women, women aged 35-45) versus universal screening of all reproductive-age women.

### Supplementation Strategy and Dosing Optimization

Our dose-response finding suggesting optimal effects at moderate doses (18-27 mg/day) has important implications for clinical practice and public health recommendations. Current clinical practice often employs high-dose iron (65-200 mg elemental iron) for documented deficiency, based on historical assumptions about dose-response relationships and the desire for rapid repletion. However, our findings, combined with the FORTE trial results (Karregat et al., 2025) and alternate-day dosing evidence (Stoel et al., 2023), suggest that lower, more frequent dosing may achieve comparable efficacy with improved tolerability.

For population-level prevention and treatment of IDWA, moderate-dose supplementation (18-27 mg/day) represents a pragmatic approach with several advantages. First, this dose range is readily available in over-the-counter prenatal vitamins, women's multivitamins, and standalone iron supplements, enabling widespread access without prescription requirements. Second, moderate doses are associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects than high-dose regimens, potentially improving adherence and long-term persistence. Third, daily moderate dosing avoids the hepcidin-mediated absorption inhibition that may limit bioavailability of high-dose regimens. Fourth, the safety margin is favorable, with minimal risk of iron overload in non-deficient individuals at these doses.

Public health policy must weigh fortification versus supplementation strategies for addressing population-level IDWA. While wheat flour fortification has successfully reduced iron deficiency anemia in many countries, its impact on IDWA specifically is less well-characterized. Targeted supplementation programs for high-risk groups—such as women with documented heavy menstrual bleeding, postpartum women, or women planning pregnancy—may offer more efficient resource utilization than population-wide interventions. Our finding that 18.5% of women currently use iron supplements suggests substantial existing uptake, but the suboptimal ferritin levels observed among many users indicates need for improved guidance on dose selection, duration, and monitoring.

## Strengths of the Study

This analysis possesses several notable strengths that enhance its validity and generalizability. First, the use of NHANES data provides a nationally representative sample of the US civilian non-institutionalized population, with findings directly generalizable to approximately 28 million non-pregnant women aged 18-45 years. The complex multistage probability sampling design, with oversampling of minority populations, ensures adequate representation of demographic subgroups often underrepresented in clinical research.

Second, the large sample size of 6,125 participants provides statistical power to detect modest associations and enables precise estimation of prevalence with narrow confidence intervals (9.0%, 95% CI: 8.3%-9.7%). This precision exceeds that achievable in smaller clinical studies and supports reliable subgroup analyses by race/ethnicity, age, and other demographic characteristics.

Third, the use of objective laboratory measures of iron status—including serum ferritin measured by standardized assays, hemoglobin, and available inflammation markers (CRP)—reduces measurement error compared to self-reported outcomes. While ferritin measurement is subject to physiological variability, the standardized NHANES laboratory protocols and quality control procedures ensure consistency across survey cycles.

Fourth, the inclusion of multiple NHANES cycles (2015-2020) enhances temporal generalizability, with findings reflecting contemporary iron status patterns rather than historical trends. The pre-pandemic timeframe avoids potential disruptions to healthcare access, dietary patterns, and supplement use that may have occurred during COVID-19.

Fifth, comprehensive covariate adjustment—including demographic factors (age, race/ethnicity), socioeconomic variables (education, poverty income ratio), dietary patterns, health behaviors, and reproductive history—reduces confounding and strengthens causal inference within the constraints of observational design. The persistence of significant supplement associations after full adjustment suggests robust relationships not explained by measured confounders.

## Limitations

### Cross-Sectional Design and Causal Inference

The fundamental limitation of this study is its cross-sectional design, which precludes establishment of temporal relationships and causal inference. We cannot determine whether supplement users initiated iron supplementation due to documented deficiency (in which case observed associations reflect treatment effects rather than primary prevention) or for prophylactic reasons unrelated to baseline iron status. Similarly, the observed association between supplementation and higher ferritin may reflect reverse causation: women with higher ferritin may be more likely to continue supplementation due to perceived benefit or healthcare provider recommendation. The temporal ambiguity inherent in cross-sectional data limits our ability to infer causality from observed associations, despite the statistically significant relationships identified.

### Self-Reported Supplement Use and Measurement Error

Iron supplement use was assessed through self-report on the NHANES dietary supplement questionnaire, introducing potential measurement error from multiple sources. Participants may inaccurately recall supplement use over the past 30 days, particularly for intermittent or sporadic use patterns. The questionnaire does not capture detailed information about supplement formulation (ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, iron bisglycinate chelate), which may vary substantially in elemental iron content and bioavailability. Duration of use, adherence patterns, and reasons for initiation are not systematically assessed, limiting our ability to distinguish chronic prophylactic use from acute therapeutic use for documented deficiency. Dose estimation relies on participant report of typical intake, which may not accurately reflect actual consumption. These measurement limitations likely attenuate observed associations toward the null, suggesting that true supplementation effects may be larger than our estimates indicate.

### Single Ferritin Measurement and Temporal Variability

Our analysis relies on a single serum ferritin measurement per participant, which does not capture intraindividual biological variability in iron stores. Ferritin levels fluctuate in response to acute inflammation, recent illness, diurnal variation, and menstrual cycle phase, with coefficients of variation typically ranging from 15-30% for repeated measurements within individuals. This biological variability may lead to misclassification of iron status, particularly for women with ferritin values near diagnostic thresholds. Women with ferritin slightly above 15 μg/L on the measurement day may have true iron deficiency when averaged across time, while women with ferritin slightly below 15 μg/L may represent transient rather than chronic deficiency. This misclassification would bias prevalence estimates toward the null and potentially obscure true supplementation effects.

### Missing Data and Survey Cycle Limitations

While we utilized multiple NHANES cycles (2015-2020) to maximize sample size, not all variables of interest were available in all cycles. Key potential confounders—including detailed menstrual bleeding assessment, previous anemia history, and specific iron loss sources—are not systematically captured in NHANES. The absence of validated fatigue or symptom scales in NHANES precludes assessment of the clinical significance of observed ferritin differences, limiting our ability to connect biomarker changes to patient-reported outcomes documented in clinical trials. Additionally, some survey cycles had limited data availability for certain variables, necessitating careful handling of missing data and potential selection bias from complete-case analysis.

### Timing of Supplementation vs. Measurement

A critical limitation of our cross-sectional approach is the inability to assess timing relationships between supplement initiation and laboratory measurement. For women reporting supplement use, we cannot determine whether supplementation began days, weeks, or months prior to the NHANES examination. Given that ferritin changes become detectable within 2-6 weeks of supplementation initiation and near-normalization typically occurs by 12 weeks (Vaucher et al., 2012), the observed association likely reflects chronic rather than acute supplementation effects. However, women who initiated supplementation shortly before NHANES participation may not yet demonstrate measurable ferritin changes, leading to underestimation of true treatment effects. Conversely, women who discontinued supplementation before the examination may have residual elevated ferritin despite reporting no current use, potentially inflating associations among "non-users."

### Unmeasured Confounding

Despite comprehensive adjustment for measured confounders, residual confounding from unmeasured or poorly measured variables may influence observed associations. Heavy menstrual bleeding, a major determinant of iron status, is not directly assessed in NHANES and can only be inferred from proxy measures such as regular menstruation and parity. Previous history of iron deficiency anemia—a strong predictor of recurrent deficiency—is not systematically captured. Dietary iron intake is estimated from 24-hour recalls with known measurement limitations. Health consciousness and healthcare access, which may influence both supplement use and iron status through multiple pathways, are imperfectly captured by available socioeconomic variables. Genetic factors affecting iron absorption and metabolism are not assessed. These unmeasured confounders may bias observed associations in unpredictable directions, necessitating cautious interpretation of effect estimates.

## Future Research Directions

### Longitudinal Studies and Temporal Relationships

Prospective longitudinal studies are urgently needed to establish temporal relationships between iron supplementation and ferritin changes in the IDWA population. Such studies should enroll women with documented IDWA (ferritin <15-30 μg/L with normal hemoglobin), randomize to various supplementation strategies, and follow ferritin trajectories over 3-6 months with frequent measurements. These designs would clarify the time course of ferritin response, identify predictors of treatment response, and enable assessment of durability of treatment effects after supplementation cessation. Additionally, longitudinal cohort studies tracking iron status across the reproductive lifespan—from menarche through menopause—would illuminate the natural history of iron depletion and identify critical windows for intervention.

### Randomized Trials in IDWA Populations

While multiple RCTs have documented benefits of iron supplementation for fatigue reduction in IDWA, several gaps remain in the evidence base. Future trials should explicitly compare moderate-dose (18-27 mg/day) versus high-dose (60-80 mg/day) strategies, with attention to both efficacy (ferritin repletion, symptom improvement) and tolerability (adherence, gastrointestinal side effects). Alternate-day versus daily dosing strategies require direct comparison in IDWA populations, building on the Stoel et al. (2023) findings in iron-deficient women. Most importantly, trials should assess patient-centered outcomes beyond biomarker changes—including validated fatigue scales, cognitive function testing, exercise tolerance, and quality-of-life measures—to establish the clinical significance of ferritin improvements.

### Investigation of Alternative Dosing Strategies

Our unexpected finding of strongest effects at moderate doses (18-27 mg/day) warrants mechanistic investigation. Future research should examine hepcidin dynamics in response to various dosing strategies, using serial hepcidin measurements alongside ferritin and iron absorption markers. Pharmacokinetic studies comparing immediate-release versus extended-release formulations would inform product selection recommendations. Studies assessing concomitant nutrient interactions—particularly vitamin C enhancement of iron absorption and calcium inhibition—would optimize dosing guidance. Investigation of timing (morning versus evening dosing) and meal interactions would translate findings into practical clinical guidance.

### Research on Higher Ferritin Thresholds

The discrepancy between WHO <15 μg/L thresholds and physiologically-based ~25 μg/L thresholds requires resolution through clinical outcomes research. Studies should assess symptom prevalence, functional impairment, and treatment response across the ferritin spectrum from 15-50 μg/L to determine whether the higher threshold identifies women with clinically meaningful iron deficiency. Intervention trials randomizing women with ferritin 15-25 μg/L to iron versus placebo would directly test the clinical significance of this "borderline" range. Biomarker studies examining erythrocyte indices, soluble transferrin receptor, and other functional indicators across ferritin levels would clarify the biological basis for threshold selection. Ultimately, clinical guideline development requires evidence that treatment of women with ferritin 15-25 μg/L produces clinically meaningful benefits outweighing costs and risks.

### Cost-Effectiveness of Screening Programs

Economic analyses are needed to inform policy decisions regarding expanded IDWA screening. Cost-effectiveness models should compare current standard-of-care (hemoglobin-based anemia screening only) against expanded strategies including ferritin testing for women with symptoms, heavy menstrual bleeding, or other risk factors, and universal ferritin screening for all reproductive-age women. These analyses must incorporate the full spectrum of potential benefits—including reduced fatigue, improved work productivity, prevention of anemia progression, and improved pregnancy outcomes—against costs of testing, supplementation, and potential adverse effects. Threshold analyses examining the ferritin cutoff at which treatment becomes cost-effective would directly inform guideline development.

### Population-Specific Research

Our finding of differential IDWA prevalence by race/ethnicity warrants deeper investigation into mechanisms and tailored interventions. Studies examining dietary patterns, cultural practices affecting iron intake, genetic factors affecting iron metabolism, and healthcare access barriers in high-prevalence populations would inform targeted interventions. Research on iron status in non-Hispanic Black women is particularly needed given their paradoxically lower IDWA prevalence but higher anemia prevalence, which may reflect differential contributions of iron deficiency versus other anemia etiologies. Similarly, the higher IDWA prevalence observed among Mexican American women requires investigation of dietary, socioeconomic, and healthcare access factors that may be amenable to intervention.

## Conclusion

This nationally representative analysis demonstrates that iron deficiency without anemia affects approximately 9.0% of US non-pregnant women aged 18-45 years when applying WHO ferritin thresholds, with prevalence estimates expanding substantially when physiologically-based thresholds around 25 μg/L are employed. Iron supplementation is associated with modestly higher ferritin levels (6.4% increase), with moderate-dose supplementation (18-27 mg/day) showing the strongest associations. These findings, contextualized within an extensive literature documenting symptomatic burden and treatment efficacy, support calls for expanded screening, threshold reconsideration, and evidence-based supplementation strategies for this prevalent yet underrecognized condition affecting millions of American women.
