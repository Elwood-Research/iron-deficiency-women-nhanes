# Conclusion: Iron Deficiency Without Anemia in US Women of Reproductive Age

## Principal Findings

This nationally representative study of 6,125 non-pregnant US women aged 18-45 years establishes that iron deficiency without anemia (IDWA) represents a prevalent condition affecting approximately 9.0% (95% CI: 8.3%-9.7%) of this population when employing World Health Organization diagnostic criteria (serum ferritin <15 μg/L with normal hemoglobin). Three principal findings emerge from our analysis with important implications for clinical practice and public health policy.

First, the prevalence of IDWA exhibits substantial demographic variation. Mexican American women experience the highest deficiency rates (11.6%), followed by non-Hispanic White women (8.8%) and non-Hispanic Black women (6.5%). Age-related patterns demonstrate peak prevalence among women aged 36-40 years (10.3%), consistent with cumulative iron depletion across the reproductive lifespan from menstrual blood loss and parity. These disparities identify priority populations for targeted screening and intervention efforts.

Second, iron supplementation demonstrates a statistically significant association with improved iron status. In fully adjusted models controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health behavior factors, supplement users exhibited 6.4% higher ferritin levels than non-users (β=0.062, p=0.048). This finding supports the biological plausibility of supplementation benefits, though effect sizes are modest compared to randomized clinical trials, likely reflecting observational design limitations and measurement error in self-reported supplement use.

Third, dose-response analysis reveals unexpected patterns with strongest associations observed at moderate doses (18-27 mg/day, β=0.207, p<0.001) rather than higher doses. This finding, which exceeds the magnitude of associations for lower doses (1-17 mg/day) and higher doses (≥28 mg/day), suggests optimal dosing ranges that warrant further investigation through randomized trials. The moderate dose category corresponds to standard over-the-counter prenatal and women's multivitamin formulations, indicating that readily available supplements may provide meaningful benefits for population-level iron status.

## Clinical Significance

The clinical significance of IDWA extends beyond the biochemical abnormality of low ferritin to encompass measurable symptom burden and functional impairment. Our prevalence estimate of 9.0% translates to approximately 2.5 million US women affected by IDWA using WHO thresholds, with this figure expanding to 10-12 million women when physiologically-based thresholds around 25 μg/L are applied. This substantial prevalence, combined with evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrating 47.7% fatigue reduction with iron supplementation (Vaucher et al., 2012), establishes IDWA as a clinically important condition warranting systematic attention.

The symptomatic burden of IDWA disproportionately affects women in their peak productive and reproductive years. Fatigue, cognitive impairment, reduced exercise tolerance, and decreased quality of life—documented extensively in clinical trial literature—interfere with occupational performance, educational attainment, and family responsibilities. The concentration of highest prevalence among women aged 36-40 years, a period of peak career and family demands, amplifies the societal impact of this underrecognized condition. Effective identification and treatment of IDWA represents an opportunity to improve functional status and quality of life for millions of women while potentially preventing progression to iron deficiency anemia with its associated healthcare costs.

Our finding that 18.5% of women currently use iron supplements indicates substantial existing awareness and uptake of supplementation, yet the persistent IDWA prevalence suggests suboptimal implementation. Many women may use supplements intermittently, at subtherapeutic doses, or without appropriate monitoring to guide duration of therapy. The identification of moderate doses (18-27 mg/day) as showing strongest associations offers practical guidance for clinicians counseling patients on supplement selection. Rather than defaulting to high-dose prescription iron with associated gastrointestinal side effects and adherence challenges, moderate-dose over-the-counter options may provide effective, tolerable alternatives for many women.

## Public Health Recommendations

Our findings support several evidence-based recommendations for public health policy and clinical practice. First, expanded ferritin screening should be considered for women of reproductive age, particularly those with symptoms suggestive of iron deficiency (fatigue, poor concentration, exercise intolerance), heavy menstrual bleeding, multiparity, or other risk factors. Current standard-of-care focusing exclusively on hemoglobin-based anemia screening misses the majority of iron-deficient women, delaying diagnosis and treatment until more advanced deficiency develops.

Second, the WHO ferritin threshold of <15 μg/L warrants reconsideration in light of consistent physiologically-based evidence supporting ~25 μg/L thresholds. While <15 μg/L identifies women with established iron deficiency, the 15-25 μg/L range likely represents a borderline zone where iron-deficient erythropoiesis begins and symptoms may emerge. Clinical guidelines should incorporate this nuance, recommending heightened attention to women with ferritin in the 15-30 μg/L range and considering treatment for symptomatic women even when ferritin exceeds 15 μg/L.

Third, moderate-dose iron supplementation (18-27 mg/day) should be considered as first-line therapy for IDWA, with high-dose regimens reserved for severe deficiency or documented malabsorption. This approach aligns with our dose-response findings and offers practical advantages: over-the-counter availability, favorable tolerability profiles, and reduced risk of adverse effects. Alternate-day dosing strategies may further improve tolerability while maintaining efficacy, based on emerging evidence from randomized trials.

Fourth, targeted interventions for high-prevalence populations—particularly Mexican American women and women aged 35-45 years—may optimize resource allocation. Culturally appropriate education, improved healthcare access, and community-based screening programs could address observed disparities. Dietary interventions emphasizing iron-rich foods and absorption enhancers (vitamin C) may complement supplementation efforts.

## Call to Action

We urge clinicians, healthcare systems, and policymakers to recognize IDWA as a distinct clinical entity requiring systematic attention. For clinicians, we recommend:

- **Screen symptomatic women**: Check ferritin in women of reproductive age presenting with unexplained fatigue, poor concentration, reduced exercise tolerance, or heavy menstrual bleeding, regardless of hemoglobin status.

- **Consider higher thresholds**: Interpret ferritin results with awareness that levels below 25-30 μg/L may indicate iron depletion with clinical significance, even when above the traditional 15 μg/L cutoff.

- **Recommend moderate-dose supplementation**: Initiate therapy with 18-27 mg elemental iron daily (or alternate-day for sensitive patients), available in over-the-counter prenatal vitamins or women's multivitamins.

- **Monitor appropriately**: Reassess ferritin at 8-12 weeks to document response, with ongoing monitoring every 3-6 months during continued supplementation.

- **Address underlying causes**: Evaluate and manage heavy menstrual bleeding, dietary insufficiency, and other iron loss sources concurrent with supplementation.

For healthcare systems and policymakers, we recommend:

- **Expand laboratory panels**: Include ferritin in standard preventive health assessments for reproductive-age women, alongside hemoglobin.

- **Update clinical guidelines**: Revise anemia-focused guidelines to explicitly address IDWA, incorporating physiologically-based ferritin thresholds and evidence-based treatment protocols.

- **Support research funding**: Prioritize randomized trials comparing dosing strategies, longitudinal studies of natural history, and cost-effectiveness analyses of expanded screening.

- **Address health disparities**: Develop targeted programs for high-prevalence populations, including culturally appropriate education and improved healthcare access.

## Final Statement

Iron deficiency without anemia represents a prevalent, underrecognized, and treatable condition affecting millions of US women during their peak productive and reproductive years. The convergence of our epidemiological findings with extensive clinical trial evidence demonstrating symptomatic improvement with treatment establishes IDWA as a public health priority meriting systematic attention. The identification of demographic disparities, dose-response relationships, and at-risk populations provides actionable guidance for clinicians and policymakers seeking to address this burden. By expanding screening, reconsidering diagnostic thresholds, and implementing evidence-based supplementation strategies, the healthcare community can meaningfully improve the health and quality of life for millions of American women currently suffering from preventable iron deficiency. The time has come to move IDWA from an incidental laboratory finding to a recognized clinical indication for evaluation, treatment, and prevention.
