# Iron Deficiency Without Anemia and Supplement Usage Effects in Women

## Research Question
What are the effects of iron supplement usage on ferritin levels, other iron biomarkers, and related symptoms in non-pregnant women aged 18-45 with iron deficiency without anemia?

## Study Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. Determine the prevalence of iron deficiency without anemia (IDWA) in non-pregnant women aged 18-45 in the US population
2. Assess the relationship between iron supplement usage and ferritin levels in women with IDWA
3. Evaluate the association between supplement use and other iron biomarkers (serum iron, TIBC, transferrin saturation)

### Secondary Objectives
1. Identify symptoms associated with iron deficiency without anemia
2. Examine dose-response relationships between supplement dosage/duration and iron status improvement
3. Compare iron status between supplement users and non-users
4. Assess demographic and lifestyle factors associated with IDWA and supplement use

## Key Variables of Interest

### Iron Status Biomarkers
- Ferritin (FERTIN): Primary indicator of iron stores
- Serum Iron (FETIB): Circulating iron levels
- Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC): Iron transport capacity
- Transferrin Saturation: Calculated from iron and TIBC

### Anemia Assessment (CBC)
- Hemoglobin (defining anemia threshold)
- Hematocrit
- Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)
- Red blood cell distribution

### Supplement Data (DSQTOT)
- Iron supplement use (yes/no)
- Dosage and frequency
- Duration of use
- Total iron intake from supplements
- Multivitamin use (often contain iron)

### Population Selection (DEMO + FASTQX)
- Age: 18-45 years
- Sex: Female
- Pregnancy status: Exclude pregnant women (from FASTQX)
- Race/ethnicity
- BMI

## Expected Outcomes
1. Prevalence estimates of IDWA in the target population
2. Effect sizes for supplement use on ferritin and iron biomarkers
3. Identification of symptom patterns in IDWA
4. Clinical guidance for supplementation strategies
