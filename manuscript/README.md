## Key Findings

### Primary Results
- **Sample:** 6,125 non-pregnant women, 18-45 years (representing ~28 million US women)
- **IDWA prevalence:** 9.0% (95% CI: 8.3%-9.7%) - approximately 2.5 million US women affected
- **Iron supplement use:** 18.5% of participants
- **Mean age:** 32.1 years
- **Mean BMI:** 28.4 kg/m²
- **Median ferritin:** 37.2 ng/mL

### Demographic Patterns
- Mexican American women: 11.6% IDWA (highest prevalence)
- Non-Hispanic Black women: 6.5% IDWA (lowest prevalence)
- Non-Hispanic White women: 8.8% IDWA
- Peak prevalence in ages 36-40: 10.3%

### Regression Results
- **Model 1 (unadjusted):** β=0.081, p=0.007
- **Model 2 (demographics-adjusted):** β=0.049, p=0.120
- **Model 3 (fully adjusted):** β=0.062, p=0.048
- **Interpretation:** 6.4% higher ferritin with iron supplementation

### Dose-Response Analysis
- Low dose (<18 mg): Non-significant (β=-0.009, p=0.833)
- **Moderate dose (18-27 mg):** β=0.207, p<0.001 (strongest effect, 23% higher ferritin)
- High dose (≥28 mg): Non-significant (β=0.023, p=0.727)

## Statistical Notes

### Survey Weighting
- Weights adjusted for 8 pooled NHANES cycles: WTMEC2YR / 8
- Variance estimation: Taylor series linearization with SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU
- Design effects: 2.3-2.8 (effective sample size ~2,200-2,700)

### Regression Models
- Outcome: Natural log-transformed ferritin (ng/mL)
- Model 1: Unadjusted
- Model 2: Adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, poverty ratio
- Model 3: Additionally adjusted for BMI
- Interpretation: Geometric mean ratios (percentage difference)

### Significance Levels
- Primary analyses: α=0.05
- Multiple comparisons: Bonferroni correction applied
- Significance markers: *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001
